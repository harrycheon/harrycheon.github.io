I am currently an **MS Computer Science** student at *University of California, San Diego (UCSD)*, advised by Prof. [Berk Ustun](https://www.berkustun.com/). 

My current interests lie in **artificial intelligence safety and alignment, robustness and interpretability in machine learning**.

During my time as a student at UCSD, I have been fortunate enough to work with [Berk Ustun](https://www.berkustun.com/), [Benjamin Smarr](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/smarrlab), [Zhiting Hu](http://zhiting.ucsd.edu/) and Intel Corporation.

<!-- Aside from my academic pursuits, I enjoy playing and talking about sports (baseball, basketball, golf), and cooking. I am also an avid techie, particularly enthusiastic about electric cars and computers.

If you have any questions or would like to collaborate, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Fun Fact 1: I am a [third culture kid (TCK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid), born in South Korea, but raised in Hong Kong since I was 10!

Fun Fact 2: I was a member of the lion dance team in my high school (I'm the one holding my partner at the back, AKA the "tail")!  ![Lion Dance](/images/lion.jpg) -->
